## Overview

The [workflow](.github/workflows/main.yml) will build a Jekyll [blog](blog/), in a container, on every Pull Request, and will update an Amazon ECS service with the new container image on every push to `master`.

## Actions

The workflow uses the following actions from AWS:

1. [`aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/configure-aws-credentials-action-for-github-actions)
1. [`aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/amazon-ecr-login-action-for-github-actions)
